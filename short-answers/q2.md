# Question
What's an example of when RegEx would solve a problem that would be difficult to solve with other tools?

# Answer
RegEx is a powerful tool to use when manipulating or validating test. For example, take question 8 and 9 of this assignment, we can easily validate if things like usernames or format sensitive items are formated correctly with RegEx by testing and matching. I imagine if we didn't have regEx it would take a lot of effort and loops to achieve the same goal.
