# Question
`replaceAll` is a handy new function that will match all instances of a given pattern. But what is the regex that will allow `replace` to get *all* instances of a pattern?

# Answer
The regex that will allow us to replace to retrieve all instances of a pattern within a string is the global flag /.../`g` that occurs after the regex syntax. This flag captures all of the matches in a string rather than just the first find which would occur without the global flag.
