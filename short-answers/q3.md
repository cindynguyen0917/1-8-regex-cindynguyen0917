# Question
Why would you want to use a `\b` character class instead of a `\s` character class?

# Answer
You would want to use the `\b` character class over the `\s` character class when you want to find matches within a string that contains punctuation. For example, if you had a fully formed sentence as a string but needed to retrieve a letter that comes before a question mark, `\b` will be helpful since it will match to any special characters (characters that are not letters or numbers) without including them in the word boundary. `\s` is used when characters are surrounded by whitespace.
